# Progress

*(Updated 2025-04-25)*

This document tracks the overall project status and evolution:

- **What Works:** 
  - Complete Home Assistant integration:
    - Automation management (list, get, create, update, delete)
    - Entity control and monitoring
    - Media player control
    - Scene management
    - Theme control
    - System updates
  - WebSocket integration:
    - Real-time event subscriptions (now in `events.ts`)
    - Live entity state updates
    - Configuration validation
    - Custom event firing (now in `events.ts`)
    - Service discovery (now in `services.ts`)
  - Node-RED integration:
    - Flow management and deployment
  - MQTT messaging capabilities
  - Secure authentication handling
  - All tests pass after the latest refactor

- **To Be Built:** 
  - Enhanced error handling and recovery
  - Additional tool documentation
  - WebSocket reconnection testing
  - Event subscription timeout handling
  - Potential new tools based on user feedback

- **Current Status:** 
  - Project is fully operational
  - All core tools implemented and functional
  - WebSocket client implemented and tested
  - Testing framework in place
  - TypeScript types and interfaces defined
  - Tools are now split by domain and protocol (REST vs WebSocket)
  - Tool registration is explicit in `src/index.ts`

- **Known Issues:** 
  - None critical at present
  - Some tools may need additional error handling
  - WebSocket reconnection might need fine-tuning
  - Event subscription timeouts need optimization

- **Decision Log:**
  - Implemented modular tool architecture
  - Added comprehensive TypeScript support
  - Integrated with both HA and Node-RED APIs
  - Added MQTT messaging support
  - Implemented WebSocket client for real-time features
  - Chose EventEmitter pattern for WebSocket events
  - Added automatic WebSocket reconnection
  - Implemented promise-based WebSocket commands
  - Split event and service WebSocket tools into dedicated files for maintainability
  - All tool registration is now explicit in the main entrypoint
